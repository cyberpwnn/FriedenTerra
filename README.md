* Sign up for github
* Download the github desktop application
* On this page, click the fork button on the top right
* Go onto the desktop application and click the plus button on the top left, click the clone tab, and select FriedenTerra.
* Once the job has finished, be sure to click the sync button to ensure your project is up to date with the master project.
* To begin editing textures, simply right click the FriedenTerra project (on the left sidebar) and click view in explorer
* Navigate through /resources/packs. In there you can edit any of the three (future, past, modern). DO NOT EDIT THE DEFAULT FOLDER. Simply copy files from that folder if the resource pack does not yet contain the source.
* Once you like the resource pack, and want to push the update, simply go back to the github application. It should show you what you changed with a text box below the list. Simply type in some text explaining what you did, and within 24 hours (usually 4), i will merge it with master!
